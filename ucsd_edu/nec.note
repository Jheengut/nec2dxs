Subject: NEC-2 FORTRAN sources
Status: R


Brian:

    I have a copy of the FORTRAN sources for NEC-2 (Numerical
Electromagnetics Code - Version 2). The header of the code says:

     NUMERICAL ELECTROMAGNETICS CODE (NEC2)  DEVELOPED AT LAWRENCE
C     LIVERMORE LAB., LIVERMORE, CA.  (CONTACT G. BURKE AT 415-422-8414
C     FOR PROBLEMS WITH THE NEC CODE.  FOR PROBLEMS WITH THE VAX IMPLEM-
C     ENTATION, CONTACT J. BREAKALL AT 415-422-8196 OR E. DOMNING AT 415

    I interpret that as meaning that this stuff is PD, since,

    1 - It's government contracted research.

    2 - There's no copyright statement.

    I would be willing to send you the file for posting on UCSD, if
you feel it is appropriate. I see no difference between this code and
the MININEC code currently posted on SIMTEL as far as ownership is
concerned. The only issue I see is that I don't believe the code will
run "as-is", except perhaps on a VAX (which I don't have :-).

    Please let me know what you think, and if you want it, I'll send
you the code.

        Pete

I didn't realize you have anonymous ftp write permission. I'm
transferring it now...into the "incoming" subdirectory. 

nec-2.f  294131   Jan 14 14:57     Fortran source code for NEC-2

    This code is marked as being for the VAX. I don't know. People who
want to use it should count on doing some work, but I believe the code
is complete and will compile (with some changes most likely :-)
    
    Two manuals are available from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS) *  which describe the code and how to use it. They are:

    NTIS AD-A075289  Naval Ocean Systems Center
                     Technical Document 116 
                     Volume 1
                     Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC)
                        - Method of Moments

    NTIS AD-A075460  Naval Ocean Systems Center
                     Technical Document 116
                     Volume 2
                     [same title]

    Volume 1 contains the code and theory, volume 2 contains the
user's guide.

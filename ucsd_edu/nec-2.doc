Subject: NEC-2 FORTRAN Sources available 
Date: Thu, 30 Jan 1992 11:03:55 -0500


    I have posted the FORTRAN source code for NEC-2 on UCSD.EDU:

    /hamradio/nec-2.f

    It's available for anonymous FTP thanks to Brian Kantor's efforts.

    A few notes:

        1. This is FORTRAN-77 source code, with some VAX specific
           modifications. I have not tested it (look at my .sig).
		   It's *not* the official NEC-2 source, it's been hacked
		   a bit, but it's pretty close to what was released originally.
		
        2. There is no documentation with the code except for whatever
           comments are embedded.

        3. It is, as far as I know, public domain, having been developed
           by an agency of the US Gov't. There's no copyright
           statement on the code I received. I got it from a friend of
           a friend (at Purdue Univ, I think).

        4. You're on your own getting it running on your system. 

    Documentation:

        The code is documented in two (huge!) manuals, available for
    purchase from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS).
    They're in the phone book in Springfield, Virginia, 22161. Call
    them and ask them about current selling price & shipping info on the
    following two publications (you want both of them):

    NTIS  AD-A075289  NOSC TD-116 Vol 1
                      Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC)
                      - Method of Moments

    NTIS  AD-A075460  NOSC TD-116 Vol 2
                      [same title]

    The above two manuals completely document the code. They contain,
    among other things, a listing of the complete code as released
    (which agrees fairly well with what's archived on UCSD.EDU, but there
    are some differences), theory of operation and instructions for use.

    Help:

        *Please* don't call me for help getting the code running. It's
    not mine and I'm paid by my company to do other things. You're on 
    your own. I think it's possible, but it takes a bit of work. I
    have tried & have had some success, but I'm not there yet. If you
    get it running, it would be nice to hear about it.


    73,
    Pete

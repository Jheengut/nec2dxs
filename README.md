NEC2 Antenna Modeler converted to current Fortran 95

This is a work-in-progress.

Currently it barely compiles with gfortran and doesn't process the model correctly.



The initial commit is the oldest NEC2 source I could find. It's from ucsd.edu and has the double precision changes in it.

Then I merged in the nec2dxs version from Arie Voors in the Netherlands, the author of the 4NEC2 visual NEC environment for windows. It has all his changes to av018 made on 10-oct-08.  This was still the current source as of the beginning of November 2013. Other files from him are in the 4nec2 subdirectory.
